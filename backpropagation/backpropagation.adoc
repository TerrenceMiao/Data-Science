Principles of backpropagation
=============================

To illustrate this process of multi-layer neural network employing backpropagation algorithm.

Each neuron is composed of two units. First unit adds products of weights coefficients and input signals. The second unit realises nonlinear function, called neuron activation function. Signal _e_ is adder output signal, and _y = f(e_ is output signal of nonlinear element. Signal _y_ is also output signal of neuron.
